The Weather Dashboard is a web application designed to provide users with real-time weather information for a specified location. It aims to deliver accurate and up-to-date weather data in a user-friendly interface, enabling users to plan their activities based on current and forecasted weather conditions. ☀️🌧️

#Features ✨:
Search by Location 🔍: Users can enter a city name to retrieve current weather and a 5-day forecast.
Current Weather Display 📊: Shows temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions for the selected location.
5-Day Forecast 📅: Displays a 5-day weather forecast with key details like temperature and precipitation.
Responsive Design 📱💻: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
Local Storage 💾: Saves recent searches for quick access to previously viewed locations.
Weather Icons 🖼️: Visual representation of weather conditions using icons for better user experience.

#Technologies Used 🛠️:
HTML5 📄: For structuring the web page.
CSS3 🎨: For styling and responsive design (e.g., Bootstrap or custom CSS).
JavaScript ⚙️: For dynamic functionality and API integration.
OpenWeatherMap API 🌐: To fetch real-time weather data.
Local Storage 🗄️: To store and retrieve recent search history.
Fetch API 📡: For making asynchronous HTTP requests to the weather API.

#Short Notes / Sample Content 📝:
How It Works 🔄: The application uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data based on user input. The data is parsed and displayed dynamically on the dashboard. Recent searches are stored in the browser's local storage for quick access. 🚀

#Sample Usage 🌍:
Enter a city (e.g., "London") in the search bar and click "Search." 🔎
View the current weather (e.g., "Sunny, 20°C, Humidity: 65%") and a 5-day forecast. ☀️
Click on a saved city from the search history to quickly view its weather. ⏰

#Setup Instructions 🛠️:
